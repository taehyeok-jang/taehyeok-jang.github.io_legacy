## About BD4H 

This course exist at intersection of Healthcare and Big Data.

- Healthcare applications/dataset 
- Data science, Big data analytics (algorithms, systems for processing and analyzing big data) 



## Learning Goals 

- Understand healthcare data
- Understand different analytics algorithms 
- Understand big data systems 



Throughout the course, we build models on health care data (ex. models for individual disease risk prediction, recommending treatments, cluster patients ) 



## Current Problems in Healthcare 

Healthcare industry is huge, and there are a lot of data coming out of health care.

U.S. health care is incredibly expensive! 3.8T$ per year.

There is a massive waste in health care. 765B$ per year. 

- High cost 
- High waste
- Low quality 

Preventable deaths rank no.3 of causes of death, following cancer and heart disease. 



## The Four Vs

- Volume (ex. human genome 200GB raw data, single fMRI 300GB) 
- Variety (ex. clinical, patient generated date. On-device) 
- Velocity (coming in real-time, need to be processed and analyzed. Ex. blood pressure, temperature, heat rate) 
- Veracity (a lot of noises, missing data, errors, false alarms)
